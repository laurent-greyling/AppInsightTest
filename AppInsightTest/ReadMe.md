This is an app to send some requests and log to Application Insights.

Here we will also get some information back from Application Insight. This will be done by directly calling the REST API

See API documentation [here](https://dev.applicationinsights.io/documentation/overview)

__NOTE__ as this is a .Net core console app, you will need to create your Application Insight resource as General for this to work proper.
